#Welcome to Package Hero.

I guess you're wondering what Package Hero is all about after all, why else would you be here huh? To best explain what Package Hero is, imagine this scenario:

You're a company providing users with an overseas address that they can send their packages to after shopping online from their favourite retailers like ebay or Amazon.com. When the package arrives at your warehouse to be prepared to be sent to their home address abroad, you realize there's some problems (Oops!). The package is broken, or maybe missing an invoice or missing the address or their unique address number so you don't even know who the package is for.... Yikes... The issues that can arise are endless!
That's where Package Hero comes in.

What can package hero do for you?

Package Hero can make handling these issues easier by keeping track of every package with issues:

Create unlimited issues
Upload up to 5 images of each package
Pick the main issue with the package
Enter a description of the problem
Enter updates on each issue that your users can see which show up instantly
Mark issues as resolved or if you have operations in different countries, hide issues that don't relate to you and that country
Other features of Package Hero include

Administrator / Standard user accounts
Create users from the app
A main dashboard that ties in all features together in a clean UI
Statistics on the dashboard such as total issues, hidden issues and available users (some stats available only to logged in admins
Search for any package with its tracking number whether it has been resolved or not
AND MANY MORE

Responsive & Modern

Package Hero works well on your Laptops, Desktops and Smartphones (we are working on tablets) and is built for the modern web with HTML5, CSS, jQuery, MySql and PHP.

Secure

User passwords are not stored in plain text and is hashed (SHA512 + salt coming soon) which makes it harder for the bad guys to access your user's account information.
