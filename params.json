{"name":"Package Hero","tagline":"Package Issue Management made simple","body":"### Welcome to Package Hero.\r\n\r\nI guess you're wondering what Package Hero is all about after all, why else would you be here huh?\r\nTo best explain what Package Hero is, imagine this scenario:\r\n> You're a company providing users with an overseas address that they can send their packages to after shopping online\r\n> from their favourite retailers like ebay or Amazon.com. When the package arrives at your warehouse to be prepared to\r\n> be sent to their home address abroad, you realize there's some problems (Oops!).\r\n> The package is broken, or maybe missing an invoice or missing the address or their unique address number so you don't\r\n> even know who the package is for.... Yikes... The issues that can arise are endless! \r\n\r\nThat's where Package Hero comes in.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What can package hero do for you?\r\nPackage Hero can make handling these issues easier by keeping track of every package with issues:\r\n\r\n* Create unlimited issues\r\n* Upload up to 5 images of each package\r\n* Pick the main issue with the package\r\n* Enter a description of the problem\r\n* Enter updates on each issue that your users can see which show up instantly\r\n* Mark issues as resolved or if you have operations in different countries, hide issues that don't relate to you and that country\r\n\r\nOther features of Package Hero include\r\n* Administrator / Standard user accounts\r\n* Create users from the app\r\n* A main dashboard that ties in all features together in a clean UI\r\n* Statistics on the dashboard such as total issues, hidden issues and available users (some stats available only to logged in admins\r\n* Search for any package with its tracking number whether it has been resolved or not\r\n\r\nAND MANY MORE\r\n\r\n\r\n### Responsive & Modern\r\nPackage Hero works well on your Laptops, Desktops and Smartphones (we are working on tablets) and is built for the modern web with HTML5, CSS, jQuery, MySql and PHP.\r\n\r\n### Secure\r\nUser passwords are not stored in plain text and is hashed (SHA512 + salt coming soon) which makes it harder for the bad guys to access your user's account information.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe project was created and maintained by @kenicenoel in November 2015 originally for Web Source Company LTD but can easily scale for similar companies.
