<p>I guess you're wondering what Package Hero is all about after all, why else would you be here huh?
To best explain what Package Hero is, imagine this scenario:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You're a company providing users with an overseas address that they can send their packages to after shopping online
from their favourite retailers like ebay or Amazon.com. When the package arrives at your warehouse to be prepared to
be sent to their home address abroad, you realize there's some problems (Oops!).
The package is broken, or maybe missing an invoice or missing the address or their unique address number so you don't
even know who the package is for.... Yikes... The issues that can arise are endless! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's where Package Hero comes in.</p>

<h3>
<a id="what-can-package-hero-do-for-you" class="anchor" href="#what-can-package-hero-do-for-you" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What can package hero do for you?</h3>

<p>Package Hero can make handling these issues easier by keeping track of every package with issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create unlimited issues</li>
<li>Upload up to 5 images of each package</li>
<li>Pick the main issue with the package</li>
<li>Enter a description of the problem</li>
<li>Enter updates on each issue that your users can see which show up instantly</li>
<li>Mark issues as resolved or if you have operations in different countries, hide issues that don't relate to you and that country</li>
</ul>

<p>Other features of Package Hero include</p>

<ul>
<li>Administrator / Standard user accounts</li>
<li>Create users from the app</li>
<li>A main dashboard that ties in all features together in a clean UI</li>
<li>Statistics on the dashboard such as total issues, hidden issues and available users (some stats available only to logged in admins</li>
<li>Search for any package with its tracking number whether it has been resolved or not</li>
</ul>

<p>AND MANY MORE</p>

<a id="responsive--modern" class="anchor" href="#responsive--modern" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Responsive &amp; Modern</h3>

<p>Package Hero works well on your Laptops, Desktops and Smartphones (we are working on tablets) and is built for the modern web with HTML5, CSS, jQuery, MySql and PHP.</p>

<h3>
<a id="secure" class="anchor" href="#secure" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Secure</h3>

<p>User passwords are not stored in plain text and is hashed (SHA512 + salt coming soon) which makes it harder for the bad guys to access your user's account information.</p>
